*   Python function time complexity calculator   *
*                                                *
*      A program by Billy Li and Ricky Peng      *
*                                                *
* Instructions:                                  *
*   1. paste your functions that you wish to     *
* test into the 'testfunction.py' file.          *
*   2. Run the "calculator" file.                *
*   3. Follow the prompts and enter information  *
* about your function's parameters.              *
*   4. The functions should have its scaling     *
* parameter (the one O(N) calculations are based *
* on) as its first parameter: e.g:               *
*   def function(scale,constant)                 *
*   5. Read the test result.                     *
*                                                *
